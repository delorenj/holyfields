# 33GOD Service Developer

Expert guide for onboarding new microservices into the 33GOD event-driven ecosystem.

## Core Principles

Services in 33GOD are:

- **Passive Consumers**: Sleep until relevant events arrive on Bloodbank (RabbitMQ)
- **Single Responsibility**: Do one thing well (e.g., "Process Transcripts", "Calculate Costs")
- **Stateless**: Store state in Vault (filesystem) or database, not in memory
- **Event-Driven**: React to events rather than being called directly

## Architecture Context

33GOD uses Bloodbank (RabbitMQ topic exchange) as its event bus. All services:

- Subscribe to specific routing keys via durable queues
- Receive EventEnvelope-wrapped messages
- Publish events back to Bloodbank for other services

**Registry**: `/home/delorenj/code/33GOD/services/registry.yaml` is the single source of truth for:
- Service definitions and metadata
- Event routing mappings
- Service topology layers

## Service Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning & Registration

1. **Define the service purpose**
   - What single responsibility does it serve?
   - What events trigger it?
   - What events does it produce?

2. **Register in registry.yaml**
   - Add service entry under `services`
   - Define queue name and routing keys
   - Add to `event_subscriptions` mapping
   - Place in appropriate topology layer

See [references/registry_guide.md](references/registry_guide.md) for registry schema and examples.

### Phase 2: Implementation

1. **Scaffold from template**
   ```bash
   cd /home/delorenj/code/33GOD/services
   cp -r templates/generic-consumer/{{cookiecutter.service_slug}} ./my-new-service
   ```

2. **Implement FastStream consumer**
   - Use FastStream with RabbitBroker (ADR-0002 pattern)
   - Unwrap EventEnvelope in handler
   - Use Pydantic models for payload validation

See [references/faststream_patterns.md](references/faststream_patterns.md) for implementation patterns.

### Phase 3: Configuration & Dependencies

1. **Update pyproject.toml**
   - Add bloodbank as local dependency
   - Include any service-specific dependencies

2. **Configure environment**
   - Define settings in `src/config.py`
   - Use Pydantic BaseSettings

3. **Docker setup**
   - Update Dockerfile if needed
   - Ensure bloodbank volume mount for local dev

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment

1. **Write tests**
   - Create `tests/test_consumer.py`
   - Mock EventEnvelope and payload
   - Test handler logic in isolation

2. **Local testing**
   ```bash
   cd services/my-new-service
   uv run pytest
   ```

3. **Run service**
   ```bash
   uv run faststream run src.consumer:app
   ```

## Reference Files

Detailed guides for specific aspects:

- **[registry_guide.md](references/registry_guide.md)**: Registry schema, examples, topology layers
- **[faststream_patterns.md](references/faststream_patterns.md)**: FastStream implementation patterns, EventEnvelope handling
- **[testing_guide.md](references/testing_guide.md)**: Testing strategies, mocking patterns
- **[deployment_guide.md](references/deployment_guide.md)**: Docker, environment configuration, running services

## Quick Reference

**Common routing key patterns**:
- `domain.event.action` (e.g., `fireflies.transcript.ready`)
- `#` wildcard for all events (infrastructure services only)
- Hierarchical namespacing (e.g., `theboard.meeting.*`)

**Service types**:
- `event-consumer`: Subscribes to events, performs work
- `event-producer`: Produces events (often FastAPI services)
- `hybrid`: Both consumer and producer

**Status values**:
- `active`: Running in production
- `planned`: Defined but not implemented
- `deprecated`: Being phased out
